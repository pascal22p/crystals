C Revision 1.49  2005/01/23 08:29:11  rich
C Reinstated CVS change history for all FPP files.
C History for very recent (January) changes may be lost.
C
C Revision 1.2  2004/12/13 16:16:08  rich
C Changed GIL to _GIL_ etc.
C
C Revision 1.1.1.1  2004/12/13 11:16:08  rich
C New CRYSTALS repository
C
C Revision 1.48  2004/03/16 12:19:00  rich
C Double size of store arrays to 64Mb.
C
C If a directive has a maximum count of >= 9999, then treat this as a
C special case, allowing an infinite number of directives of this
C type to be issued. (Suggest that if any directives really do
C need a maximum count to prevent, e.g. a runaway loop somewhere, then
C they be set to 9998).
C
C Revision 1.47  2003/09/29 15:38:34  rich
C Added \DEFINE system instruction for building the command file. No
C need for separate executable anymore. This command is \REMOVEd in
C the normal startup file to prevent accidents.
C
C Revision 1.46  2003/06/27 11:59:04  rich
C Globally replace FRAGMENT (slot in L5) and FRAGMENT(...) lexical keyword
C with RESIDUE. This should reduce confusion about what it is, and as FRAGMENT
C is only months old, no-one should notice the change anyway. So now it is
C #EDIT
C DELETE RESI(1) RESIDUE(2)
C END
C to delete residues 1 and 2.
C
C Revision 1.45  2003/06/27 09:19:52  rich
C Common block XFLAGS to hold bit-masks for information (RIDE,RIGID,DIST/ANGLE
C RESTRAINT/OCC CONSTRAINT etc) which is to be stored in L5, and later output
C to CIF to meet Acta requirements.
C
C Revision 1.44  2003/06/09 11:33:09  rich
C Set value of IOPBND.
C
C Revision 1.43  2003/05/07 12:18:54  rich
C
C RIC: Make a new platform target "WXS" for building CRYSTALS under Windows
C using only free compilers and libraries. Hurrah, but it isn't very stable
C yet (CRYSTALS, not the compilers...)
C
C Revision 1.42  2003/02/27 12:48:03  rich
C Change keyword for identifying slot 17 from "HYBRID" to "FRAGMENT".
C
C Revision 1.41  2003/02/27 11:49:50  rich
C
C Two BRAND NEW lexical things:
C
C  You can now use, wherever appropriate, REISDUE(1,X's) syntax to
C  select all atoms whose fragment number (slot 17 in L5) matches. This
C  works in EDIT, LIST 12, DIST, REGULARISE etc.
C
C  You can now use, wherever appropriate, TYPE(H,X's) syntax to
C  select all atoms whose type matches that given. This
C  works in EDIT, LIST 12, DIST, REGULARISE etc. Main use I can think
C  of is to quickly FIX all H positions (especially if using RESI to specify
C  bits to refine) or to special case a few heavy atoms: TYPE(AU,U'S).
C
C  If you say FULL U[ISO] TYPE(PB,U's) - it causes an error - this is better
C  than going silently crazy I suppose, but It would be nice if it just
C  overrode the iso setting, like FIX does: i.e. ALL(X'S) followed
C  by FIX(H,X'S) works as expected.
C
C Revision 1.40  2003/01/15 14:04:47  rich
C Add a character variable BLANKS to XCONST common block. Initialise it with
C spaces.
C
C Revision 1.39  2003/01/14 18:31:35  rich
C Right - this is a useful one and I'm quite pleased with it.
C
C Added a new lexical token PART to the scanner. The following
C examples show what you might do with it:
C ----
C Get distances between all atoms in part 1:
C   #DIST
C   INCLUDE PART(1)
C   END
C ----
C Competitively refine the occupancy of two parts, e.g. in disorder:
C   #LIST 12
C   FULL X'S U'S
C   EQUIV PART(1,OCC) PART(2,OCC)
C   WEIGHT -1 PART(1,OCC)
C   END
C ----
C Quickly id whole fragments in regularise:
C   #REGUL
C   target c(1) to c(6)
C   ideal c(11) to c(16)
C   cameron
C   map part(2)
C   onto part(1)
C   END
C ----
C Move a part of the structure:
C   #EDIT
C   ADD 0.2 PART(3,X)
C   END
C ----
C Have different regimes for refining e.g. a host and a guest molecule:
C   #LIST 12
C   FULL PART(0,X'S,U'S) PART(1,X'S,U[ISO])
C   END
C ----
C So it's quite handy. Part numbers are stored in the 15th slot of LIST 5, and
C are defined as follows:
C   ( 1000 * GROUPNUMBER ) + COMPONENTNUMBER.
C     e.g. 123456 is group 123 and component 456.
C   The same syntax is used to select a part in the lexical input:
C     e.g. PART(123456) selects atoms in group 123, component 456.
C   BUT, if the value of the group or component is 999, all atoms in that
C   group or component are selected.
C     e.g. PART(999003) selects all atoms with component 3 in their partnumber and
C     PART(4999) selects all atoms in group 4.
C
C The reason for having groups and parts is to enable logical grouping of, for example
C a disorder where all affected atoms are group 1, with each component being part 0,1,2 etc.
C
C NB. #script xparts runs a useful tool for defining part numbers.
C
C Revision 1.38  2002/12/04 14:31:11  rich
C Reformat output during refinement.
C
C Allow punching to MATLAB files, including restraints.
C
C Tidy some routines.
C
C Revision 1.37  2002/11/29 15:25:38  rich
C Add a variable MATLAB to XSFW common block, and zero it in presets. Keeps
C track of open files.
C
C Revision 1.36  2002/08/23 11:20:26  richard
C Increase STR11 and SORT to 32Mb each (8-fold increase), to allow refinement of
C bigger structures.
C
C Revision 1.35  2002/03/15 16:50:01  richard
C Type #SET BONDTYPE OFF to suppress bond type calculation.
C
C Revision 1.34  2002/03/12 18:02:50  ckp2
C GUIUP stores list serial numbers in a saved array. Moved it into common, clear out
C every re-start in presets.
C
C Revision 1.33  2002/02/27 19:24:55  ckp2
C RIC: Increase store to 32Mb. (The released versions have had this much store
C for over a year, I'd just never dared to check it in before.)
C
C Revision 1.32  2002/01/09 14:59:47  Administrator
C bound shifts, abandon ill-conditioned problem

C Implementation of Lists 40 and 41.
C ===================================
C New commands:
C #LIST 41 - contains a list of bonds and bondtypes. It is generated by typing
C #BONDCALC which calculates bonds from LIST1,2,5,29 and 40.
C 40 contains info about how to do the bond calculation and can override
C covalent radii, force or break specific bonds and set limits for pairs
C of elements.
C #PUNCH 40 A - produces a LIST 40, #PUNCH 40 B - produces a #BONDING command
C which may be used to input a list 40 in a more user friendy manner (no READ
C card). #BONDING may also be used to EXTEND an existing list 40.
C #SUM L 40 - summary of bonding building info. #SUM L 41 - the bonds.
C #BONDCALC creates a L40 if there is none, and also only carries out calculation
C if significant change has occured to L5. (unless "#BONDCALC FORCE").
C See manual for more details.
C
C Revision 1.30  2001/09/11 08:27:43  ckp2
C Cut down GUI traffic by only sending status updates for flags that have
C actually changed (Flags: L1, L2, L3, L5, L6, QS, IN)
C
C Revision 1.29  2001/06/19 08:19:19  richard
C Increased store limits as two people have now hit the barrier for LIST 16
C size. A complete recompilation of all fortran sources is required for consitency.
C Do at least a "code fortran", or a "buildall" to be really sure.
C
C Revision 1.28  2001/01/17 11:04:11  richard
C Default to logging everything. Initialisation doesn't log anyway.
C
C Revision 1.27  2001/01/11 17:36:41  richard
C Initialise IOFORE and IOBACK, or no text appears to start with.
C
C Revision 1.26  2000/12/01 17:06:51  richard
C RIC: Change default release year to 2000
