C Revision 1.59  2003/11/06 15:48:01  rich
C Improved part numbering rules. The group bit of the number (digits > 1000)
C should now be called the assembly number. The number may now be negative,
C the -ve sign is given to the part digits (<999) and these atoms are not
C allowed to form bonds to the same part using symmetry operators. Useful
C for assemblies disordered across a sym op.

C If BONDTYPE is set to OFF, remove list of special bonds from list 41
C (L41S), since this bit is only ever changed by the BONDTY routine.
C If bond type in L41 is zero, display 'unassigned' on model, rather
C than memory access violation.

C Commented out unused routines - saves 50Kb off the executable.
C
C Revision 1.52  2003/07/16 16:02:58  rich
C Added code to \REGROUP, so that if the MOVE parameter is -ve, then
C a covalent radius vector is provided to KDIST1, and the absolute
C value of MOVE is used as a TOLERANCE, such that bonds are formed
C if D < COV1+COV2+TOLERANCE.
C
C Revision 1.51  2003/07/09 17:02:20  rich
C Problem: New CIF script includes cell esd's in distance calculation, this
C makes C-H distances for riding H's have a non-zero esd. (Correctly, I might
C add). However checkcif cares not for this number, so we must detect riding
C H's and explicitly set the bond esd to zero after it is computed. Needless
C to say, this only happens if you explicitly set the \DIST HESD parameter to
C 'NONFIXED' which you're not likely to do by accident. The only place that
C does this is the XCIF script.
C
C Revision 1.50  2003/07/01 16:43:34  rich
C Change IOR intrinsics to OR, similarly: IAND -> AND, INOT -> NOT. The "I"
C prefix is for INTEGER*2 (16 bit) types only, so could overflow when fed
C data from CRYSTALS' store. The unprefixed versions take any type and return
C the same type.
C
C Revision 1.49  2003/06/27 11:55:03  rich
C
C  If an angle involves a riding hydrogen atom, zero the esd to supress PLATON
C  warnings.
C
C Revision 1.48  2003/06/20 11:39:53  rich
C
C Increase maximum parts per parameter (MXPPP) from 10 to 50.
C
C In KDIST4 (analagous to KDIST1, but returns distances from
C List 41) keep track of the List 12 pointers if required.
C
C Made XCOVAR more consistent - the VCV returned for distances
C or angles is now always pre and postmultiplied by the
C matrix of constraint for the given atoms. The 'weight' vector
C that is returned is now always a unit matrix. Previously
C XCOVAR treated atoms with single part and multi part
C paramters differently.
C
C Also, the diagonal multiplier matrix that was computed for
C atoms with multipart parameters (XFWM) isn't required since
C in these cases the multiplier information is already applied
C to the VCV: a unit matrix is now returned.
C
C Revision 1.47  2003/06/09 13:45:34  rich
C Use correct module ID when generating errors in bond calculation
C routines. IOPBND.
C
C Revision 1.46  2003/05/22 11:21:57  rich
C In function MAKE41 (constructs a list of bonds from atom coords), add extra
C logic so that any symmetry operation that is not I, and does not move an
C atom is ignored. This prevents two bonds being formed to atoms on
C special positions. This mattered not for display, but it matters much to
C Mogul.
C
C The BREAK directive in L40 breaks bonds that would otherwise form and be
C stored in L41. If you explicitly give a symmetry operator,S, of zero,
C then all bonds between the pair of atoms will be broken, even if related
C by symmetry. For example: Imagine a Zn(1) on a 2-fold axis. Imagine it
C is coordinated by a carboxylate anion. Imagine that the C(1) atom is
C accidentally bonding to the Zn(1) - it shouldn't only the O's should
C bond. You say "BREAK ZN(1) TO C(1)", but the ZN(1) TO C(1,2) remains.
C Now you can say "BREAK ZN(1,0) TO C(1,0)" and all ZN(1)-C(1) bonds are
C broken, hurrah.

C When adding new items to L29 either set colour to 'UNKN', or find the correct
C colour. (This L29 remains loaded and will be used by XGUIUP).
C
C Revision 1.26  2002/07/23 15:51:33  richard
C If XBCALC is called internally, with MODE 2 (i.e. from #EDIT), then don't
C even think about trying to write L41 back to disk - bad things will happen
C due to #EDIT claiming bits of store without asking.
C
C Revision 1.25  2002/07/23 10:02:09  richard
C
C INSERT NCONN and INSERT RELAX use L41 to work out bonding. L41 is dangerously
C useless if L5 has been sorted in #EDIT. One can now call XBCALC(2) to recalculate
C bonds. L5 is not reloaded in this mode.
C
C Revision 1.24  2002/07/19 08:56:25  Administrator
C Typo.
C
C Revision 1.23  2002/07/18 17:26:04  richard
C
C New #DISTANCE directives: NOTBONDED [atoms or types]
C                           NOTPIVOT [atoms or types]
C
C Specifically excludes the specified atoms from being either
C pivots or bonded atoms. Useful because: if I want all the bonds
C from peaks to non-peaks, I can now say PIVOT Q / NOTBONDED Q and
C it will do the trick.
C
C New #DISTANCE option: OUTPUT LIST=DEBUG
C
C Every time you issue INCLUDE/PIVOT/BONDED/EXCLUDE/NOTBONDED/NOTPIVOT this
C option prints a list of all the atoms along with the three column vectors
C which specify where an atom can appear in a distance or angle result.
C Useful to see what exactly is going on.
C
C New #DISTANCE option: OUTPUT MONITOR=PEAKSTOGUI
C
C For each pivot atom this option outputs the pivot with its SPARE value,
C and the distance to the closest of the bonded atoms and its name -
C (Like this: ^^WI 'Q(1) height: 1.43, 1.243A from C(11)') - allowing
C it to be added to a listbox in the GUI. You probably want to use the options
C PIVOT Q and NOTBONDED Q in conjunction with this option. See script XPRUNE
C for an example.
C
C Revision 1.22  2002/07/17 09:29:49  richard
C
C In #DISTANCE added option: SEL RANGE=L41
C This will use the bond list (41) to determine what is connected.
C
C In #DISTANCE added option: OUT PUNCH=DELU D1DEV=x D2DEV=y
C This will output VIBR restraints to the punch file with an esd
C of x for 1,2 distances and y for 1,3 distances. You probably want an
C EXCL H if using the DELU option.
C
C In #DISTANCE added option: OUT PUNCH=SIMU S1DEV=x S2DEV=y
C This will output U(IJ) restraints to the punch file with an esd
C of x for normal bonds and y for terminal bonds. A bond is terminal
C if it connects to an atom with no other connections except hydrogen.
C This option uses LIST 41 to determine whether the atom is 'terminal',
C but the RANGE can still be set at user's discretion. You probably want an
C EXCL H if using the SIMU option.
C
C In #EDIT added option: INSERT NCONN
C This will put the number of connections to other atoms (according to L41)
C into the SPARE slot in List 5.
C
C In #EDIT added option: INSERT RELAX
C This will start with the electron count of each atom in SPARE, and
C keep cycling through the bond list, adding the current value of
C SPARE to all the neighbouring atoms. It will cycle until the number
C of unique values of SPARE stops increasing.
C
C distangl.src now contains a routine KDIST4, which works like KDIST1 but using
C the existing L41. It should be noted that the bond lengths stored in L41
C may be out of date as the bonding is only recalculated every now and again.
C
C Revision 1.21  2002/06/26 10:30:52  richard

C
C Implementation of Lists 40 and 41.
C ===================================
C New commands:
C #LIST 41 - contains a list of bonds and bondtypes. It is generated by typing
C #BONDCALC which calculates bonds from LIST1,2,5,29 and 40.
C 40 contains info about how to do the bond calculation and can override
C covalent radii, force or break specific bonds and set limits for pairs
C of elements.
C #PUNCH 40 A - produces a LIST 40, #PUNCH 40 B - produces a #BONDING command
C which may be used to input a list 40 in a more user friendy manner (no READ
C card). #BONDING may also be used to EXTEND an existing list 40.
C #SUM L 40 - summary of bonding building info. #SUM L 41 - the bonds.
C #BONDCALC creates a L40 if there is none, and also only carries out calculation
C if significant change has occured to L5. (unless "#BONDCALC FORCE").
C See manual for more details.
C
C Revision 1.13  2001/09/04 14:54:54  ckp2

C
C Revision 1.10  2001/03/28 13:34:21  richard
C Update Andy Brown's code to generate dummy atoms compatible with the new list 5 format.
C
C Revision 1.9  2001/03/28 12:53:18  richard
C Recent changes in KDIST1 (pivot and bonded related) broke Andy's void code.
C The good news is that it's now better than ever.
C
C Revision 1.8  2001/03/08 14:24:13  richard
C Revamped the way this works a bit. KDIST1 overhauled to get rid of unnecessary jumps
C and deprecated fortran stuff - seems easier to understand now ;)
C ONLY (dirctive on it's own) simply causes the function vector to be used for INCL/EXCL
C only, it no longer takes arguments. (Used to work like INCLUDE).
C INCLUDE - as before, but disables PIVOT and BONDED directives. Any set of directives
C featuring an INCLUDE will result in all non-specified atom being EXCLUDED.
C EXCLUDE - as before, on it's own all non-specified atoms are INCLUDED.
C PIVOT - atom can be a pivot in the calculation. Disables the INCLUDE directive. All
C non specified atoms will be type BONDED, unless there is a BONDED directive, in which case
C non-specified atoms are excluded.
C BONDED - atom can be bonded to in the calculation. Disables the INCLUDE directive. All
C non-specified atoms will be type PIVOT, unless there is a PIVOT directive, in which case
C non-specified atoms are excluded.
C
C Revision 1.7  2001/01/22 16:49:25  richard
C Fix array overflow when using include in #dist after List12 has been previously loaded.
C
C Revision 1.6  2001/01/18 11:33:29  richard
C Added new DISTANCE DIRECTIVES:
C OUTPUT PUNCH=SCRIPT - outputs easily script-readable bond info to the punch file.
C PIVOT atomspec - outputs all bonds and/or angles where atomspec is the PIVOT atom.
C BONDED atomspec - output all bonds where atomspec is bonded to.
C Both PIVOT and BONDED set ALLDIST to YES, the difference is in the output. PIVOT
C atoms always appear first and at the centre of angles. If you say
C #DIST / OUT PUNCH=SCRIPT / BONDED H / END - then the punch file will contain the pivot
C atom, say C, followed by a list of H's bonded to it. Useful for constructing a
C set of riding H instructions, I think.
